# Brown Bear Creative - Full Stack Project
Created by Melissa Mackie
Start Day: 7/27/23

## A bit about my project
This project will be a full stack project simulating a full design and development build of an ecommerce retail site that sells custome crafted goods and digital goods. The file called brownbearcreative outside of the project folder has my devlog that details my todo list and thought process and notes as I work on this project. This is a long term project as it is a huge scope and I am pacing myself to make sure everything is proper and with good practice. All images here are not real products and utilze free resources or licensed resources. 

## Current Plans
Currently I am in the design phase as I just got started. I have 2 weeks slated to design the fully responsive site (small, med, large, and ex large viewports). The first due day set upon myself is AUG 10th 2023 where I will begin coding the mobile view of the site.

If you wish to reach out to me to discuss my plans for this site. I am more than happy to talk about it.
